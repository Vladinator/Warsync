warsync (0.9.8+rc0.9.9+3) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is version 0.9.9 Release-Candidate 3 and new features may not work
    as expected.
  * Dynamic client-side exclude support implemented with .warsyncignore files.
  * Client-side pre, mod, and post command support implemented for filepacks.
    Pre commands run on the client prior to syncing. Mod commands run after
    syncing only if modifications were made. Post commands run after syncing
    even if no modifications were made.
  * Warsync event tracking implemented so multiple server processes will not
    try to perform the same operation on a client.
  * If the installed version of rsync supports it (v2.6+), rsync process will be
    restarted when files disappear from the server during rsync instead of
    causing an error.
  * If running rsync v2.6.4 or higher, files will be deleted from the client
    incrementally (using --delete-during rsync option) instead of at the
    beginning of the rsync process. This will speed up the rsync process. See
    documentation for reverting back to old behavior.
  * Server will no longer replicate all clients if a non-existant client is
    specified on the command line.
  * When adding new clients to a server, user is asked if they want client to
    be skipped by default when replicating all clients.
  * Specifying RSYNC_OPT options in a filepack actually works now.
  * New filepack option DELETE when set to a false value, the filepack will not
    delete files from the warsync client that do not exist on the server.
  * New filepack option SKIP will cause a filepack to not be included when
    running warsync --all-filepacks.
  * Many minor improvments and bug fixes.
